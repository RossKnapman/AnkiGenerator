# AnkiGenerator

Takes in a list of words I don't know from books read in a foreign language (generated from my highlights on my Kindle), looks them up on Linguee, gets examples of their use in a sentence (both English and the translation), and puts them into a CSV file that can be added to my Anki flashcards. Also spits out the words for which exapmles of use in sentences cannot be found in a separate file.
